This project processes the Ta Feng dataset to identify frequent itemsets using the SON Algorithm. The dataset, available on Kaggle (https://bit.ly/2miWqFS), 
consists of transaction data, where each transaction includes a customer ID, purchase date, and product IDs. The primary goal is to aggregate all 
purchases made by a customer within a single day into one basket and then apply the SON Algorithm to find frequent itemsets from the pre-processed data.
